# PS6_WebApp

My data was taken from the University of Alabama Hunstville, where they studied the temperatures in celsius of the lower troposphere, the lowest level of our atmosphere, and where humans live.

On my opening page, I gave a brief description of my data, and printed a random sample of 10 entries

Within my plot panel tab, the user has the ability to select the month of data they want to view. 1 = January, 2 = February, 3 = March, etc. They can also change the color of the data if they please. The plot displays the temperature over the years based on the certain month.

On the table panel, the user can choose to view the data grouped by certain regions. They can view as many regions or as few as they please. The table displays data on the month, the year, the region, and the temperature.
